**Magenta** is a research project exploring the role of machine learning
in the process of creating art and music.  

This repository was forked from the official Magenta, and developed based on [MusicVAE](https://github.com/merfii/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/music_vae) to implement a autoencoder which can generate whole drum kit sequence from kick-only sequence. We call it [kiko-vae](https://github.com/merfii/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/kiko_vae)

If youâ€™d like to learn more about Magenta, check out their [blog](https://magenta.tensorflow.org).
